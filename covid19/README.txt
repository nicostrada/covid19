This is my first repository on GitHub.

It contains the work on the italian regional analysis of the COVID epidemy. It's composed by now of two notebooks:
- SIR2_regions: computes the SIR model applied to italian macro regions
- R0_regions: computes the R0 parameter as a function of time for each macro region
Both notebooks have a _work version in which I made all the new changes and a _export version which makes a loop over the regions and, whitout plots, exports the corresponging .csv files

The output of this repository is public in https://covstat.it

Infinite thanks to Andrea Palladino, he put the basis of this work and gave me the inspiration to work on this project!
